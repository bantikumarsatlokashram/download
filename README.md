## 🐘 PHP Implementation

The `audio_download.php` file contains a PHP implementation of the download manager 💾. This implementation serves files 📂 from the specified directory and allows users to:

- 👀 View available files in a visually appealing webpage 🖼️.
- 📥 Download individual files or all files at once.

### ✨ Features
- Uses standard HTML 📝 and JavaScript ⚙️ for a responsive UI.
- Bootstrap for styling 🎨, providing a clean 🧼 and modern look.
- Each file has an individual download button ⬇️, and there's a `Download All` option 🔄.

### 🔧 Requirements
- PHP 7.0 or later 🐘.
- Apache or any web server 🌐 capable of running PHP.

## 🐍 Python Implementation (Flask)

The Python implementation 🐍 uses the Flask framework to create a simple web server 🌐 that lists files 📂 in the specified directory.

### ✨ Features
- REST API 🔗 to fetch directory content and download files 📥.
- Uses Python's `os` 🐍 and `Flask` libraries 📚 for server-side handling.
- HTML page is rendered with Jinja2 🖼️, similar to EJS in JavaScript.

### 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.6 or later 🐍.
- Flask (`pip install Flask`).

## ☕ Java Implementation (Servlet)

This implementation uses Java Servlets ☕ to create an HTTP server 🌐 that serves files in a specified directory.

### ✨ Features
- Supports listing 📋 and downloading files 📥 using HTTP GET requests 🔗.
- Uses JSP for the frontend to dynamically generate the UI based on the server response 🖥️.

### 🔧 Requirements
- Java 8 or later ☕.
- Apache Tomcat 🐈 or any servlet container 🛢️.

## 🟢 Node.js Implementation (Express)

The Node.js version 🟢 uses the Express framework to create a lightweight file server 🌐.

### ✨ Features
- Uses Express.js 🟢 to create RESTful routes for listing and downloading files 📂.
- HTML front-end using EJS templates 🖼️ to render the file list dynamically.

### 🔧 Requirements
- Node.js 12 or later 🟢.
- Express.js (`npm install express`).

## 💻 C++ Implementation (Casablanca)

This implementation leverages Microsoft's Casablanca 💻 (C++ REST SDK) to create an HTTP server 🌐.

### ✨ Features
- Provides file listing 📋 and download functionality 📥 via a REST API 🔗.
- Written in C++, offering optimal performance 🚀 for serving files.

### 🔧 Requirements
- C++11 or later 💻.
- Casablanca (C++ REST SDK).
